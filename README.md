# KobeShots

This repository contains an analysis of the [Kobe Bryant Shot Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection)
dataset, using R 3.7.\
The aim is to use different shallow learning techniques in order to perform a binary classification on the outcome of a shot.
The algorithms considered are logistic regression, decision trees (as well as its variants, random forests and bagging),
linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors.\
In the case of logistic regression we also have a look a different techniques for model selection, such as subset selection and principal component analysis\
Some of the ideas are taken from Aris Papadopoulos's article [Machine Learning with the NBA's "Shooting Machine"](https://towardsdatascience.com/nba-data-science-93e0314bb45e),
which presents a similar approach in Python using decision trees.
